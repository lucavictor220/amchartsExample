## Moldova map using amcharts

### Instalation

1) Clone repo:
`` git clone https://github.com/lucavictor220/amchartsExample.git ``

2) Move to the directory of the project ``cd amcharts``

3) Run ``npm install`` . If any error occurs make sure you have node.js installed.

4) Open index.html in the browser.

### Usage

There is not much I've learn to customize using amcharts library, but you can find some of the things you can change in MoldovaMap.js file in commented lines. For example:
1) Adding description
2) Change color of the map regions
3) Change selection color.
